This folder contains the original fluorescence lifetime images.
Each metabolic experiment folder contains three technical replications.
1. Glycolysis and OXPHOS
2. Pyruvate 
3. Glutaminolysis
Glycolysis and OXPHOS inhibition experiments were repeated to get more orignial data for CNN model development.
